# OpenNebula backup script for QCOW2 datastores

## Description

Purpose of this script is to backup OpenNebula datastores type of file (qcow2).
This script have to run on dedicated backup server.

It backups:
- non-persistent base images - those which are used to deploy non-persistent VMs
- persistent images with live snapshoting support
    - when image is attached to VM them live external snapshot is created
    - them image is copied using rsync to backup dir
    - at the end external snapshot is blockcommited back to original image and deleted
- system datastores with deployments files - without VM images, which are non-persistent ones

## How it works

![Flow diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenNebula/addon-image-backup/develop/images/how-it-works.png)

## Authors

* Leader: Kristi√°n Feldsam (feldsam@gmail.com)

## Compatibility

This add-on is compatible with OpenNebula 5.0+, NodeJS 5.10.1+ and NPM 3.8.3+

## Requirements

### OpenNebula Front-end

* Working OpenNebula XML-RPC API with user having read access to images, datastores and VMs, and write access to images

### OpenNebula Node(s)

* The node(s) must have QEMU 2.1+, Libvirt 1.2.9+ and Rsync available.
* If you want use the weakest but fastest SSH encryption them you must specify `Ciphers arcfour128` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

Example sshd_config:
```
Ciphers arcfour128,chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com
```

* To use `netcat` option, corresponding package have to be installed 

### Backup server

* NodeJS, NPM and Rsync installed
* Password-less SSH access from the backup server to the `node` instances using `oneadmin` user.
* To use `netcat` option, corresponding package have to be installed

## Installation

### You need nodejs and npm installed on backup server

CentOS:
```
yum install epel-release
yum install nodejs npm
```

Ubuntu:
```
apt-get install nodejs
```

Nodejs have to by installed in `/usr/local/bin/node`. If is not, them just create symlink

```
ln -s /path/where/is/nodejs/bin /usr/local/bin/node
```

### Clone or download this repository and install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Usage

### Configure

```
cp config.sample.js config.js
```

```
module.exports = {
    // XML-RPC API Configuration
    address: 'http://opennebula:2633/RPC2',
    user: 'oneadmin',
    token: 'someStrongPass',
    
    // Path to where to save backups on backup server
    backupDir: '/path/to/backup/dir/',
    
    // Path where external tmp snapshot will create on compute node
    // Have to be owned by oneadmin user
    backupTmpDir: '/path/to/backup/tmp/dir/',
    
    // IP address of backup server from which we run this script
    // Used only for netcat function
    backupServerIp: '192.168.2.8',
    
    // List of compute nodes in cluster.
    // Used for downloading persistent images not attached to any vm,
    // non-persistent images and deployments files
    // This have to be valid DNS names, which resolves to IPs
    // You should copy /etc/hosts from Front-end node
    bridgeList: ['node1', 'node2', 'node3'],
                                           
    // Libvirt hypervisor connection URI
    libvirtUri: 'qemu:///system'
}
```

Configure password less SSH access to compute nodes as `oneadmin` user.
Basicly you just need copy `~/.ssh` and `/etc/hosts` from frontend node.

### List of options

```
./one-image-backup.js -h

  Usage: one-image-backup [options]


  Options:

    -V, --version          output the version number
    -i --image             <image_id>  image id or comma separated list of image ids to backup. Omit for backup all images
    -S --start-image       <image_id>  image id to start from backup. Backups all following images including defined one
    -a --datastore         <datastore_id>  datastore id or comma separated list of datastore ids to backup from. Omit to backup from all datastores
    -k --insecure          use the weakest but fastest SSH encryption
    -n --netcat            use the netcat instead of rsync (just for main image files, *.snap dir still use rsync)
    -c --check             check img using qemu-img check cmd after transfer
    -D --deployments       backup also deployments files from system datastores
    -d --dry-run           dry run - not execute any commands, instead will be printed out
    -s --skip-question     skip question about executiong backup
    -v --verbose           enable verbose mode
    -h, --help             output usage information
```

### Dry run for test

```
./one-image-backup.js -dvD
```

### Prepared bash script

There is also prepared bash script `backup.sh` for use in cron.
Script run `one-image-backup` with `k n c D v s` options.

```
k - fast rsync using weakest SSH encryption
c - check img using qemu-img check
D - backup deployments files
v - verbose - so you get report by email
s - skip confirmation question
```
